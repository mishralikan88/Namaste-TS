ANY TYPE 
========
ANY Type is the most flexible type in ts .
ANY type turns off  type checking for the variables and expressions it is applied to.
ANY Type can be used when dealing with dynamic data from dynamic sources like user inputs , API / Netweok calls. 


UNKNOWN TYPE
============
 UNKNOWN Type is Safer alternative to any.
 UNKNOWN type enforces type checking and type safety when any doesnot.


Type Safety
===========

We should be able to use function specific to specific types.


Type Checking
=============

ts checks the types of a variable at compile time.
