=================

In typescript Type annotation is a way of explicitly specifying the type of a variable , function parameter or function return value.
Type annotations are expressed by using a colon  (:) followed by the desired type after the variable or function parameters or function declaration.  


Advantages  of Type annotations
================================

helps typescript compiler (tsc) to enforce type checking and provide type safety during development.
Once Type of the variable is confirmed we can perform specific operation to that variable.For strings we can perform toUpperCase.For number we can perfomr toFixed.
