Interface Vs Type
=================

1. Use custom type when you need unions,intersections or mapped types.Use Interface when defining object shapes or classes that adhere 
to a contract.

2. Interface can extend other interfaces to inherit their members.Custom types can use unions and intersections for more complex type
 compositions.
