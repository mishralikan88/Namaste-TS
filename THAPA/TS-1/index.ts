// let num = 5   // Typescript is intellegent enough to consider num as number type .This is called Type inference in type-script.
// num = "Amar"  // string value is not assignable to a variable of type number . This is called Type checking in typescript.


// let numValue:number = 5 // Defining the type explicitly so that typescript can understand the variable Type.
// numValue = "Amar"       // Typescript restricts this behavior. In javascript it is valid.



let num:number = 5 
num = 55
