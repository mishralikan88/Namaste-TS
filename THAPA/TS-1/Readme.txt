What is type script ?

Type script is a superset of javascript with added features such as static typing , generics , Enums , tuples , Abstract classes , interfaces , unions etc.

Type Script catches error at the compile time instead of runtime which makes debugging easier and reduces the bugs in production.


Install typescript globally : npm install -g typescript 


tsc index.ts => type-script compiler compiles index.ts to index.js
