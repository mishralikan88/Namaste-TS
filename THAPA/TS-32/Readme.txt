Type Narrowing / Type Safety / Type guards
==========================================
A typeof guard in TypeScript lets you narrow down the type of a variable based on its runtime value.In Typescript, type narrowing allows
you to write type-safe code by ensuring you only operate on the correct type under certain circumstances .This is particularly useful with
union types and generic types.
