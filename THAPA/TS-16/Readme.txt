Tuples in Tuples
================

in Ts tuples are data sturctures that allow us to store a fixed size collection of elements of different types .


Tuples Vs arrays
================

They are similar to arrays but with a key difference and that is the types of elements in a tuple are fixed and declared at the time of
creation, whereas arrays can hold elements of same type and their size can vary.


syntax
======
type TupleName = [Type1,Type2,Type3]
const person1: PersonInfo = ["Amar", 30, true]; // example


usecase
=======

when we know the data already and to put those data in a coollection in a sequence , then tuple is the best choice
