Inheritance and Super Key
=========================

Inheritance allows a class (B) to reuse the functionality of an existing class(A) without rewriting it.

Inheritance is a mechnanism in which one class acquires the property of another class .For example a child inherits the traits of 
his/her parents.

Super() we call inside child class constructor class to invoke the base class constructor while initialising parent props.
